1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

**forEach is used to apply functions or changes to an existing array. .map does the same but returns a new array and does not alter the original array.**

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

**Functions and methods both are functions in JavaScript. A method is just a function which is a property of an object.** 

3. What is closure?

**Closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables — a scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets. it has access to the outer function's variables.**
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

**Global Binding - 'this' used outside of an object will refer to the window object.**
**Implicit Binding - object that invokes the function is referred to as this. "objectForThis.this"**
**New Binding - this refers to the copy built with the constructor function**
**Explicit Binding - When using call or apply, this will refer to the object that inheritance is being received from.**

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

**A new object is created and this references the new object that was created. super() allows us to access/call functions on an object's parent. It is used to avoid dupllicating the parts of the constructor that are similar.**
